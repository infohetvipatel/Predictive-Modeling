What sort of hypotheses have you formed about the data?

Hypothesis:
employee with high city development index are more likely to churn
employee with large company size are less likely to churn





------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which attributes seem promising for further analysis? 



ss



--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have your explorations revealed new characteristics about the data? 

new characteristics:
employee in company size greater than 1000 churn less
employee who have not enrolled in full time course churn more

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How have these explorations changed your initial hypothesis? 

First hypothesis is proved wrong while second seems to be right



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can you identify particular subsets of data for later use? 

(city_development_index,target) & (company_size,target)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Take another look at your data mining goals. Has this exploration altered the goals?

No our goal still remains the same.















Have you identified missing attributes and blank fields? If so, is there meaning behind such missing values? 

There were some blank values, white spaces initially but after data cleaning we have no such missing values

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are there spelling inconsistencies that may cause problems in later merges or transformations? 

No such inconsistencies have been found

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you explored deviations to determine whether they are "noise" or phenomena worth analyzing further? 

Though there were some outliars initially but after performing data cleaning, there is no noisy data found

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you conducted a plausibility check for values? Take notes on any apparent conflicts (such as teenagers with high income levels). 

employee having relevent experience churn more 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you considered excluding data that has no impact on your hypotheses? 

yes, city column has large number of missing values so we have excluded that

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are the data stored in flat files? If so, are the delimiters consistent among files? Does each record contain the same number of fields?

yes the data is stored in flat files and the delimiters are consistent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




---------Data Cleaning---------------
In Data Cleaning we have performed the following:

remove outliars
remove blanks,null,missing values
remove field wiyh too many missing values
